Question: What is a CI/CD pipeline? Include the resources you've used to answer this question.  
Answer: ## CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD pipeline is a set of processes that automate the building, testing, and deploying of applications. The pipeline consists of multiple stages starting from code development to deployment. In short, it is an automated way of building, testing, and deploying code changes to the production environment. The CI/CD pipeline makes the development process more efficient by identifying and fixing issues early and ensuring code is always deployable.

### CI Pipeline

The CI part of the CI/CD pipeline stands for Continuous Integration. It is the process of regularly integrating changes made by developers into a shared repository. The CI pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Code changes**: Developers push code changes to a shared repository such as Git.
2. **Build**: A build server pulls the latest code changes, compiles the code, and creates a deployable artifact.
3. **Test**: The build artifact is tested, including unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests.
4. **Deploy**: After the artifact passes all tests, it is deployed to a staging environment where it is further tested before being released to production.

### CD Pipeline

The CD part of the CI/CD pipeline stands for Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment. Continuous Delivery means ensuring that the code changes are always in a deployable state. Continuous Deployment, on the other hand, means that every code change that passes through the pipeline is automatically deployed to production, without any manual intervention.

The CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Commit**: Developers commit the code changes to version control.
2. **Build**: A build server pulls the latest code changes, compiles the code, and creates a deployable artifact.
3. **Test**: The build artifact is tested, including unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests.
4. **Deploy**: Once the artifact passes all tests, it is deployed to production.
