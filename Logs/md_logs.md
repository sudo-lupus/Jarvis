    \#\#\#1 Question: How do I print the current date and time in Python?  
Answer: To print the current date and time in Python, you can use the datetime module. Here's an example of how to do it:

```python
import datetime

current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
print("Current date and time:", current_time)
```

This will output something like:

```
Current date and time: 2021-06-18 14:30:45.123456
```

You can also format the output to display the date and/or time in a specific way using strftime(). Here's an example:

```python
import datetime

current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
formatted_time = current_time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
print("Current date and time:", formatted_time)
```

This will output:

```
Current date and time: 2021-06-18 14:30:45
```

In the example above, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" is the format string used to specify the desired output format. "%Y" represents the year, "%m" represents the month, "%d" represents the day, "%H" represents the hour in 24-hour format, "%M" represents the minute, and "%S" represents the second. By rearranging and adding other characters as needed, you can format the current date and time in any way you like.
