### 1. Question:  
*Iâ€˜ve just gotten a job for a position as a Cloud DevOps engineer. The job listing says that I should be familiar with powershell, VMWare - especially VSphere, CI/CD pipelines, Python scripting, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes - In that order of importance. Please make a learning plan for the following 4 weeks (with resources and links for every day). Assume I know nothing about the above topics, except that I'm an intermediate level Python Programmer. Also add an elaborate description to every learning unit which should explain Why I'm learning this and how is it relevant for DevOps Engineering. Take into account that I'll be studying 4 hours every day. Order the learning units in a way that makes the most sense.*
