# CI/CD Pipelines

CI/CD stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment, and refers to a set of practices and tools that enable teams to frequently and reliably build, test, and deploy software changes. 

A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps that build, test, and deploy software changes to production. It typically involves several steps, including:

1. **Build** - Compile code, run tests, and package the application.
2. **Test** - Run automated tests to ensure that the code works as expected.
3. **Deploy** - Deploy the application to a staging environment.
4. **Verify** - Run manual tests to ensure that the application works as expected in the staging environment.
5. **Release** - Deploy the application to production.

By automating these steps, teams can quickly and reliably release changes, reducing the risk of bugs and errors in production. 

# Tools used in CI/CD pipelines

There are a variety of tools that can be used to implement CI/CD pipelines. The specific tools used will depend on the needs of the team and the technology stack being used. Here are some of the most commonly used tools:

1. **Version control system (VCS)** - A VCS such as Git is the foundation of a CI/CD pipeline, as it enables teams to manage code changes and collaborate effectively.

2. **Continuous integration (CI) tools** - CI tools such as Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI automatically build and test code changes whenever new code is pushed to the repository.

3. **Containerization tools** - Containerization tools such as Docker enable teams to create lightweight, portable containers that can be easily deployed in any environment.

4. **Continuous deployment/delivery (CD) tools** - CD tools such as Kubernetes and Terraform automate the deployment and management of containerized applications.

5. **Monitoring tools** - Monitoring tools such as New Relic and Prometheus enable teams to monitor the health of their applications and quickly identify and resolve issues.

Overall, implementing a CI/CD pipeline can help teams deliver software changes faster and with higher quality, enabling them to respond more quickly to user needs and changes in the market.
