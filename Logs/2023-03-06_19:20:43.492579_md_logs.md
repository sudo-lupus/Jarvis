### 1. Question:  
*Iâ€˜ve just gotten a job for a position as a Cloud DevOps engineer. The job listing says that I should be familiar with powershell, VMWare - especially VSphere, CI/CD pipelines, Python scripting, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes - In that order of importance. Please make a learning plan for the following 4 weeks (with resources and links for every day). Assume I know nothing about the above topics, except that I'm an intermediate level Python Programmer. Also add an elaborate description to every learning unit which should explain Why I'm learning this and how is it relevant for DevOps Engineering. Take into account that I'll be studying 4 hours every day. Order the learning units in a way that makes the most sense.*
Week 1: Introduction to Cloud and Virtualization
- Day 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing and Virtualization. Learn about the fundamental concepts of cloud computing, virtual machines and virtualization. [Resource](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/cloud-computing-foundations-duke/introduction-to-cloud-computing-KKpDm)
- Day 2: Introduction to Microsoft PowerShell. Learn about PowerShell and Command-line interface. [Resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1)
- Day 3: Introduction to VMWare and VSphere. Learn about VMWare ecosystem and VSphere architecture. [Resource](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/products/vsphere/vmware-vsphere-esxi-vcenter-server-7-getting-started-guide.pdf)
- Day 4: Basic Networking Concepts. Learn about networking concepts and how they apply to Cloud Computing and Virtualization. [Resource](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/nmap-scanning-networks)
- Day 5: Hands-on Lab on Windows PowerShell commands for VSphere. [Resource](https://vmiss.net/useful-powercli-scripts/) 

Why: Cloud and virtualization are an essential part of DevOps. You'll gain knowledge about the concepts, tools and platforms which are highly relevant for a DevOps Engineering role.



Week 2: Continuous Integration (CI),Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) Pipelines, and Git
- Day 1: Introduction to Continuous Integration/Continuous Development(CI/CD) Pipelines, and Git Learn why CI/CD pipelines are important and their benefits, and the fundamentals of Git. [Resource](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/ci-cd-pipeline)
- Day 2: Setting up Jenkins for Continuous Integration (CI) Learn about Jenkins and how to set up CI job for a simple application. [Resource](https://www.linuxtechi.com/jenkins-installation-on-centos/)
- Day 3: Setting up Jenkins for Continuous Deployment (CD) Learn about Jenkins and how to set up a CD job for a simple application. [Resource](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)
- Day 4: Setting up a staging environment with Docker Compose Learn how to use Docker Compose in deploying an application to a staging environment.[Resource](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
- Day 5: Introduction to Kubernetes Learn about Kubernetes, its architecture and why it is important for a DevOps Engineer. [Resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/)

Why: CI/CD pipelines help automate software builds and testing, they are critical for fast, efficient and reliable software delivery.  Git is an important tool for version control, it helps you manage your code, work with teams and is necessary for setting up CI/CD pipelines. An understanding of Kubernetes, an essential container orchestration platform, is essential to work efficiently with containers in production.


Week 3: Introduction to Scripting Languages
- Day 1: Introduction to Python scripting language. Learn about Python, its syntax and control structures. [Resource](https://www.learnpython.org/)
- Day 2: Advanced Python. Learn Object-oriented programming (OOP) with Python. [Resource](https://www.educative.io/blog/python-oop-tutorial)
- Day 3: Introduction to Bash and Shell scripting. Learn the basics of Bash and Shell scripting [Resource](https://www.shellscript.sh/)
- Day 4: Advanced Bash Scripting. Learn how to write advanced Bash scripts. [Resource](https://linuxhint.com/bash_script_solutions/)
- Day 5: Introduction to Ansible Learn about Ansible and how to automate tasks using Ansible. [Resource](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-18-04)

Why: Scripting is important for efficient and reliable automation of tasks. Python is a general-purpose language that is easy to learn and has a widespread use case. Bash and Shell scripting are necessary because many of the tools and systems that DevOps engineers work with have a command-line interface. Ansible is a powerful tool in configuration management and automation.


Week 4: Advanced Topics
- Day 1: Working with Containers - Learn the basics of Docker and Kubernetes [Resource](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-kubernetes-the-practical-guide/)
- Day 2: Managing Virtual Machines using Ansible Learn about Ansible Modules and how to manage virtual machines using Ansible [Resource](https://www.ansible.com/resources/videos/whiteboard-walkthrough-managing-virtual-machines-with-ansible-modules)
- Day 3: Advanced Kubernetes Concepts - Learning Advanced Kubernetes concepts such as Deployment, Services and Scaling [Resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)
- Day 4: GitOps with FluxCD Learn about GitOps and how to use FluxCD for automating Kubernetes operations [Resource](https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/1.20.2/tutorials/get-started-helm/)
- Day 5: Cloud Security Learn about Cloud Security, best practices and how to secure cloud infrastructure. [Resource](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-security-basics)

Why: Kubernetes is essential in container orchestration and is widely used. Understanding how to manage VMs using Ansible is a way to automate infrastructure management. FluxCD is an important tool in GitOps, where you use version control for managing infrastructure automation. Finally, cloud security is essential for protecting resources, maintaining compliance and preventing unauthorized access.
